## react-tutorial-tic-tac-toe-with-6-improvements

This tic-tac-toe game was built by completely following the [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Enhancemnets

In addition, it was enhanced in the following six ways:
1. Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
2. Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

## Build & Run

After cloning the repo at a command-line terminal, go into the home directory then enter:

```
yarn
yarn dev
```

Hit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) to play the game if your browser didn't open the game for you.
