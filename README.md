This project is bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and built by the instructions of [Tutorial: Intro To React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

In addition to the basic game instructed by the tutorial, this project implements the following improvements listed in order of increasing difficulty as suggested by the tutorial:

1. Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
2. Indicate the currently selected item in the move history list.
3. Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hard-coding them.
4. Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
5. When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
6. When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

In the project directory, run:

```bash
npm start
```

to start the app in the development mode.
